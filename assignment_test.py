assignment_test.py - Test module, not really unitest although it makes unitest.
My decition to change it so I can give better feedback without the traceback.

This module contains unit tests designed to verify the correctness of student 
implementations for the exercise ce_th_assignment.ipynb. The tests will:

1. Check the accuracy and functionality of the student's code.
2. Provide clear and informative feedback for any incorrect solutions, helping 
   learners identify and correct their mistakes.

Students can execute this test module within their notebooks to independently 
assess the correctness of their code.

Usage:
- Ensure this file is in the same directory as the student's implementation.
- Run the tests to see immediate results and feedback as described in the notebook.
